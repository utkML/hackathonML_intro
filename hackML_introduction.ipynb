The plant Zenon is crawling with alien creatures, and while we don't know much about these Zenon inhabitants yet, we have collected plenty of data from satellite images. Your job is to classify each creature into one of seven species that the researchers have distinguished so far.\n",

    "Let's first read in the data (Pandas is a good way to start here). Because of the competition submission requirements, we are going to want to save the IDs for the examples in the training set. We will also want to separate the field that we are trying to predict (in the case of classification, this is often called a label). The convention is to call the field we are trying to predict 'y_train' and the set of attributes we will use to train the model (often called features) X_train. \n",
